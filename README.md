# Head First Design Patterns (2014 update)


# Code Katas

Since I read the Book "Clean Coder" I got very excited about Code Katas.
Uncle Bob tells us in his book that he is doing one or two Katas daily.
I'm tying to keep up with that



Goals for my Code Training:
# Spend 20 hours per week in addition to your work (those hours are for me - I try to spend it for reading, practicing, learning
# "Professionals spend time caring for their profession"
# "You should not be working for your company during those 20 hours. Instead you should work on your career"



Minimal List of Things that every software professional should be conversant with:

# Design patterns (describe all 25 patterns of the GOF book, including examples)
# Design principles (know the SOLID principles)
# Methods (understand XP, Scrum, Lean, Kanban, Waterfall, Structured Analysis)
# Disciplines (practice TDD, Pair Programming)
# Artifacts (UML, DFD, Petri Nets,..)
