The Decorator pattern is used in java.io


When such a constructor is been used, then all methods will delegate to the wrapped instance, with here and there changes in the way how the methods behave.
For example, buffering the stream in memory beforehand, or decompressing the stream beforehand, or interpreting the stream differently, etcetera.
 Some have even additional methods which finally also delegate further to the wrapped instance. Those methods decorate the wrapped instance with extra behaviour.
